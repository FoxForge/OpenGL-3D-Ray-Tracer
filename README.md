# OpenGL-3D-Ray-Tracer
3D scene and Light Behaviour implementation in OpenGL

Lighting Tasks Implemented:
- Ray To Scene Intersections
- Shadows formed from objects
- Refraction behaviour
- Reflection behaviour
- Phong and Blinn (Phong) specular lighting calculations
- Additionally the foundations for texture mapping have started to be created.

Test the solution with the executable. Tests using keys F1-F6.
See Code for further comments

An incomplete executable has also been added to show comparison from just being able to get a window setup.
